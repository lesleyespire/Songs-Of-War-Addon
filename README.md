This is my old weapons addon. It's a collection of custom swords in tiers, from iron, diamond, netherite and then aether.

Iron Weapons cost a lot of iron, but offer 10 damage per hit, that's more than a netherite sword.
Diamond is +2 from there, at 12 damage. It costs less diamonds than iron, but of course, diamonds are much harder to find.
Netherite costs a couple netherite ingots and increases damage to 13.

Finally, the very cool lookin (if I dare say so myself) aether weapons. They do 15 damage.

### PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS AN ACTIVE WORK AREA. MAKE SURE TO WEAR A HARD HAT WHEN PROCESSING ANY DOWNLOADS.

The addon isn't ready just yet... 

The swords load but don't yet do damage. 
The trader that sells them is invisible - (could always rename him ghost trader and turn yet another bug into a feature (; )
And the aether armour textures are a little buggy, but it is powerful and works just like it is supposed too.
